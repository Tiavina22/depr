# Developer Depression Patterns

This repo has some code examples that show developer depression, whether itâ€™s from work or love. Mental blocks, tiredness, and relationship problems come out in bugs, errors, and unfinished functions.

## Goal

To raise awareness about depression in developers, whether itâ€™s from work stuff or personal life. If you relate to these examples, please talk to someone you trust or a professional.

## Languages Covered
- Dart
- TypeScript
- Java

## Dart Depression
Are you a binary tree? 'Cause you're making my heart do a depth-first search! ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜†
```dart
void depthFirstSearchMeme() {
  print("You're making my heart do a depth-first search!");
}

void main() {
  depthFirstSearchMeme();
}
```
Are you a GitHub branch? 'Cuz I'm trying to merge with you. ðŸŒŸ
```dart
void gitBranch() {
  String you2 = "GitHub branch";
  String me = "trying to merge with you";

  if (you2 == "GitHub branch") {
    print("Are you a $you2? 'Cuz I'm $me. ðŸŒŸ");
  }
}

void main() {
  gitBranch();
}
```
I must be a function. Cause every time I look at you, I keep returning to you. ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜†
```dart
void function() {
  String iAm = "function";
  String you = "you";

  if (iAm == "function") {
    print(
        "I must be a $iAm. Cause every time I look at $you, I keep returning to you. ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜†");
  }
}

void main() {
  function();
}
```

## Java Depression
Are you an exception? Because I've caught feelings for you! ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜†
```java
public class Memes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Are you an exception? Because I've caught feelings for you!");
    }
}
```
Are you a debugger? 'Cause you make all my problems disappear. ðŸ˜†ðŸ¥¹
```java
public class DebuggerLove {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String you = "debugger";
        String me = "problems";

        if (you.equals("debugger")) {
            System.out.println("Are you a " + you + "? 'Cause you make all my " + me + " disappear. ðŸ˜†ðŸ¥¹");
        }
    }
}
```
Are you a node?? 'Cause I have a pointer to your heart ðŸ¥¹ðŸ˜†.
ðŸ”˜->null nefa...
```java
public class NodePointer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String you = "node";
        String pointer = "pointer to your heart";

        if (you.equals("node")) {
            System.out.println("Are you a " + you + "?? 'Cause I have a " + pointer + " ðŸ¥¹ðŸ˜†.");
            System.out.println("ðŸ”˜->null... mais je continue d'espÃ©rer.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Typescript Depression
Are you a closure? Because youâ€™ve captured my heart! ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜†
```typescript
function closureMeme(): void {
  console.log("You're a closure because you've captured my heart!");
}

closureMeme();
```
Will you be my compiler? 'Cause I can't run without you ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜†
```typescript
function expressFeelings() {
    const you = "compiler";
    const me = "can't run without you";

    if (you === "compiler") {
        console.log(`Will you be my ${you}? 'Cause I ${me} ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜†.`);
    }
}

expressFeelings();
```
